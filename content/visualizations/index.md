Below are select examples of my data visualizations from the Pregnancy, Arsenic, and Immune Response (PAIR) Study. The PAIR Study was a prospective birth and cohort study based in rural northern Bangladesh. It has been [described](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ppe.12949) in detail elsewhere. Briefly, the PAIR Study enrolled 784 pregnant women in the early second trimester in 2018-2019. The study followed the women to the end of pregnancy. Where pregnancy resulted in live birth, it followed mother-infant pairs to three months postpartum. This included up to two major study visits in pregnancy (below, Visits 1-2) and up to two major study visits postpartum (Visits 3-4).

### Density Plot: Maternal Hemoglobin by Study Visit

The following are two examples of density plots showing maternal hemoglobin, the oxygen-transport protein, by study visit, including Visits 1-2 in pregnancy and Visits 3-4 postpartum. The first example uses a single facet; the second example uses multiple facets.

In both examples, the distributions follow an expected pattern: a decrease in hemoglobin over pregnancy (Visit 1 to Visit 2) and an increase following live birth (Visit 2 to Visit 3 to Visit 4). Visit 3 was conducted in the weeks after live birth, when maternal hemodynamics are highly variable. The higher dispersion of the distribution at Visit 3 is consistent with this process.

#### Single Facet

#### Multiple Facets

### Scatter Plot: Maternal Hemoglobin in Pregnancy by Gestational Age

The following is a scatter plot showing maternal hemoglobin by gestational age in pregnancy only (Visits 1-2). In pregnancy, the blood plasma volume expands to support increased circulation in the woman and fetus. This results in the gradual dilution of hemoglobin.

### Scatter Plot: Urinary by Drinking Water Arsenic

The following is a scatter plot showing urinary arsenic by drinking water arsenic among pregnant women at Visit 1. Bangladesh has some of the highest arsenic exposure in the world due to naturally occurring arsenic in groundwater, which is used for drinking and irrigation. Urinary arsenic is a commonly used measure of total arsenic exposure. The plot below confirms that drinking water arsenic is a key driver of total arsenic exposure.
