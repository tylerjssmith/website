Tyler Smith is an epidemiologist studying how environmental exposures during pregnancy and childhood can alter health and developmental trajectories. His doctoral research aimed to estimate the effects of potential interventions to reduce drinking water arsenic during pregnancy on immune and respiratory outcomes among infants in [rural northern Bangladesh](https://doi.org/10.1111/ppe.12949). More generally, he is interested in combining rigorous study designs and novel statistical methods to [estimate causal effects](uploads/Smith_et_al_2022_EstimatingCausalEffects.pdf) using observational data. 

Tyler holds a PhD in exposure science and environmental epidemiology and an MPH in epidemiologic methods, both from Johns Hopkins. Before the doctoral program, he worked in [environmental policy](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118138). Tyler was born and raised in Seattle. When heâ€™s not working, he can be found hiking, skiing, or otherwise engaged on the side of a mountain.
