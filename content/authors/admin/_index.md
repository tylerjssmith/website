Tyler Smith is a data scientist with 14 years of professional experience. He is an expert at building data pipelines and machine learning models using Python, R, and SQL, visualizing results, and reporting actionable information to decision-makers.

Tyler works at the intersection of data science and cybersecurity, including the analysis of log and telemetry data, threat intelligence, and more to detect and respond to security incidents. His cybersecurity certifications include CompTIA Security+.

Tyler also combines rigorous study designs and machine learning to investigate how [environmental exposures](uploads/Smith_et_al_2022_EstimatingCausalEffects.pdf) during pregnancy and childhood can alter health and development. His current research focuses on air pollution during pregnancy in Canada. His doctoral research estimated how reductions in arsenic exposure could improve children’s health in [rural Bangladesh](https://doi.org/10.1111/ppe.12949).

Tyler holds a PhD in Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology and an MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, both from Johns Hopkins. Before the PhD, he worked in [environmental policy](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118138). Tyler was born and raised in Seattle.
